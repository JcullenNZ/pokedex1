            <h1>WELCOME TRAINER!</h1>
            <p>Learn all about the team behind this pokedex!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>James and Gabriel worked tirelessly on this for a long time, before realising that a lot of
            what they were doing was not working so well.</p>
<br />
                <p> HOWEVER! They persevered and eventually, 3 hours
            before the due date, were able to release this masterpiece to the world.</p>
            <p>Please be aware, we did have loftier goals, but life, school, and the dnd movie go in the way.
            As it often does.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We appreciated this task very much, and learned a lot through it. One day, we will update this
            to show our full strength, then we too can call ourselves Pokemon Masters.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Kindly yours,</p>
